Bruh moment #1
1/14/22


When trying to deploy code to the new roboRIO v2s that we had flashed, we received an error in IDE that the flash was bad. The flash was not, in fact, bad, but we were using an outdated version of wpilib/gradleRIO that didn't recognize the new flash file name as a valid flash. After updating to gradleRIO 2022.1.1 and fixing all the problems associated with that update, the flash error no longer appeared.

In build.gradle add:      id “com.github.ben-manes.versions” version “0.41.0"

To update to a new project gradle version (not gradleRIO version), type into terminal:     ./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version=7.3.3 --distribution-type=bin

To update to a new gradleRIO version change the version string in build.gradle in the plugin block

Verify the path to main in build.gradle follows the path to the Main class starting from, but not including, the file called java under src/main
Updated ours frc.team852.robot.Main -> frc.robot.Main

If the comm light on the roboRIO lights solid red, deploy code from WPILib VS Code and wait for RIOLog to give you some information. If any exception is thrown while the rio tries to run the main, it will consider the robot code invalid and claim to have no robot code. We verified this by commenting out everything that caused an error.

If you've just flashed by sd card and can't connect to the roboRIO, update team # in roboRIO imager tool



FOR GITHUB MANAGEMENT:

Have each member fork the repo and work in their own forked master branch. When they want to add to the master repo they can submit a pull request.
If you don't fork and only work in branches nobody has access to push to their branch without access to push to master as well, which gets messy fast.



10.8.52.11:5800 is limelight's video stream w/ cursor and fps

10.8.52.11:5801 is the browser interface for setup

10.8.52.11:5802 is limelight's clean stream, best for display



if the rio is continually rebooting it's probably browning out
